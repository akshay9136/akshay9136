Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Akshay, a Software Engineer.

My expertise lies in JavaScript and React, but my true passion is Functional Programming. This paradigm resonates with my belief in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I'm currently working on [SEE Algorithms](https://see-algorithms.com/), a project that merges my love for coding and education. Through this platform, I aim to demystify complex algorithms by transforming them into interactive and intuitive visualizations. My goal is to make learning algorithms not just informative, but also engaging and fun.

Beyond the code, I value collaboration and the exchange of ideas. I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, and contribute to open-source projects that push the boundaries of what we can achieve with technology.

Feel free to check out my work and drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshay-karande-365604130/). Let's create something amazing together!
